	Temperature control is a process in which change of temperature of a space (and objects collectively there within) is measured or otherwise detected, and the passage of heat energy into or out of the space is adjusted to achieve a desired average temperature.Much has been learned about perioperative temperature management in recent years. Most of the research has focused on the problem of hypothermia; deservingly so, because it is the most frequent and significant perioperative temperature problem and is associated with many well-known complications (discussed below).1 However, with the exception of malignant hyperthermia, relatively little attention has been directed to the appropriate management of the hyperthermic patient, in particular, the febrile patient. Section I of this article will discuss the unresolved issue of temperature management in the infected, febrile patient.

Section II will discuss the relative importance of intraoperative versus postoperative hypothermia. Because of the effective intraoperative active warming techniques now available, patients can initially become hypothermic intraoperatively but warm sufficiently, so that by the end of the surgical case, they are considered to be normothermic (i.e., ≥36.0°C). Prewarming is currently the only effective way to mitigate the initial redistribution hypothermia that occurs in all patients upon induction of general anesthesia. However, prewarming requires resource utilization, is not a standard of care, and is not universally used. Further evidence that intraoperative, and not just postoperative, hypothermia causes adverse outcomes would further demonstrate the value of prewarming and provide more impetus to use prewarming much more frequently.

Anecdotally, this author finds that the use of active warming in short duration cases varies with institutions and practitioners. The SCIP (Surgical Care Improvement Project) rules from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services evaluate the practitioners only for cases lasting more than 1 h.2 Also, it is difficult to demonstrate an increase in core temperature from our active warming techniques (e.g., forced air warming) until at least 30 min have elapsed.3,4 For both of these reasons, there may be less motivation to aggressively warm patients having short duration cases. Section III will provide arguments as to why aggressive warming techniques may be important in short duration cases, even in the absence of a demonstrable intraoperative increase in core temperature, and will suggest needed research.

	What Is the Optimal Temperature Management Strategy for the Infected Febrile Patient?

Hyperthermia, an increase of body temperature by definition, can be febrile or nonfebrile. This discussion applies to the febrile patient (i.e., a regulated increase in temperature due to an increased thermoregulatory set point) and not to nonfebrile hyperthermia (i.e., an unregulated temperature increase when the body temperature is higher than the thermoregulatory set point).

The primary treatment of febrile hyperthermia (fever) due to an infection is the treatment of the underlying infection. While such treatment is ongoing, the question at hand is whether fever is a harmful byproduct of infection or a host-defense response. If it is harmful, we should actively, or at least permissively, cool the febrile patient. If it is the latter, we should try to maintain the patient’s temperature at the increased thermoregulatory set point. Although this question may still be unanswered,5 others believe there is overwhelming evidence that fever is a beneficial part of a coordinated defense.6,7 The lines of evidence include evolutionary, correlative, antipyretic, and hyperthermia/hypothermia studies.6 For example, infectious illnesses in animals are of longer duration and mortality rates increase if the fever is treated.6 Additionally, because the febrile response is highly regulated, it likely has an adaptive role.6 Some of the enzymes involved in immune defense have their temperature optima not at 37°C, but at a higher temperature. We may have evolved to mount our best immune defense at an increased temperature.

Second, if the patient’s temperature decreases below his or her elevated thermoregulatory set point, even if the patient’s temperature is still above 37°C, the patient will postoperatively, or intraoperatively, mount a response to increase his or her temperature back to the elevated set point similar to a nonfebrile patient who becomes hypothermic. This response has a high metabolic cost and is likely undesirable. Also, there is some risk in administering antipyretic therapy to maintain the lower temperature, and antipyretics may be ineffective.5 Unfortunately, there is no way to know if the thermoregulatory set point changes during surgery, and if so by how much and in which direction. (In those patients in whom this author chooses to maintain an increased temperature, this author makes the assumption that the thermoregulatory set point will not significantly change during the surgical procedure, and thus tries to maintain the patient’s temperature at the first measured core temperature.)

Maintaining a patient at an elevated temperature increases the metabolic rate. It is estimated that for every 1°C increase in temperature, the metabolic rate increases by up to 13%. This is probably offset to some extent by the decreased metabolic rate during anesthesia. However, this increased metabolic rate may be insignificant compared with the alternative scenario. There can be a short-term increase in metabolic rate of up to 600% in the postoperative shivering patient.8 A doubling can be maintained for longer durations.9 Ciofolo et al.10 reported a more modest 80% mean increase, but 30% of their patients had significantly larger increases (200%). Maintaining normothermia has been demonstrated to reduce the postoperative metabolic rate increase that would otherwise result if the patient became hypothermic.11 With regard to causing thermal damage, increases in core temperature up to 41°C have never been shown to be harmful per se.12 In contrast, therapeutic hyperthermia with temperatures >42°C have been associated with tissue damage, such as fat necrosis.

One has to determine whether or not the benefits of remaining febrile outweigh any harm caused by the febrile state. There are specific instances in which a febrile state can be harmful. In any case where there is a possibility of neurologic injury (e.g., carotid endarterectomy, virtually all of neurosurgery and cardiac surgery, and any case in which there is a potential for a cardiac arrest), neurologic injury may be greater in the presence of an increased temperature.13 In pediatric patients, one has to be concerned about febrile seizures.14 In pregnant patients, one should be concerned about the effect of hyperthermia on the fetus. Temperatures >39°C during the first 10 wk of pregnancy when organogenesis takes place may be associated with a sixfold increased risk of neural tube defect.15 Also, although infections increase the chance of preterm labor, this may be due to the underlying disease causing cytokine release from the amniotic cells rather than the fever per se.16 Lastly, because heart rate increases as temperature increases, in patients in whom tachycardia may be harmful (e.g., ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, obstructive cardiomyopathy), decreasing the temperature can assist in treating the tachycardia. However, this may pose a dilemma if compensatory thermoregulatory mechanisms provoke tachycardia or other cardiac complications. In some cases, attempts to decrease a patient’s temperature may be overcome by the patient’s thermal regulatory system.17 Such a futile attempt would only wastefully increase catabolism and oxygen consumption while activating the sympathetic nervous system, a potential cause of morbid cardiac events.18,19

There are few data that address how one should manage the temperature of a febrile patient undergoing surgery.20 At least one textbook advocates treating the increased temperature of a febrile patient, but provides no justification for doing so, and acknowledges that it may worsen the situation.17 It is possible that the correct decision may be pathogen-specific.5 Although these are strong arguments to maintain a febrile patient at his or her elevated temperature (with exceptions), outcome studies are needed to affirm or refute this suggestion. An answer to this question would help us optimize care to our septic patients who are some of our sickest, and who have a significant mortality rate. Until there are outcome studies that answer this question, the individual practitioner should consider the above arguments in managing the temperature of a febrile patient.

Lastly, because there is currently no generally accepted demonstrable benefit to hyperthermia in nonfebrile patients, it would seem that nontherapeutic nonfebrile hyperthermia should generally be treated.
