	Before beginning a discussion of temperature, one should first understand the difference between temperature and heat. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of atoms or molecules in a substance. For example, the molecules in a pot of boiling water will move much faster than in a pot of cold water, thus giving boiling water a higher temperature. Heat, however, is a measure of the total kinetic energy of a substance. Therefore, a large cup of hot coffee would possess more heat than a smaller cup.

Temperature affects the smallest details of our daily life—from what we wear to how we get to work to what we eat for lunch. Seldom can we go even a day without needing to know what the temperature is or will be. After all, few people would want to walk to work or school in a snow storm, or can enjoy a bowl of hot soup when it is upwards of 90 degrees outside. Therefore, temperature plays an important role and it is valuable to know what temperature is, how it is measured, and what implications it may have for society as a whole.

One of the first scientists to devote serious study to temperature was the famed Italian, Galileo Galilee. Most are familiar with the thermometer he developed in the early 1600s, commonly known as the Galileo Thermometer. Though rudimentary in its design, the device was surprisingly accurate. The next great breakthrough in the study of temperature came with Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit’s invention of the mercury thermometer. He also invented the temperature scale that bears his name—the Fahrenheit scale—which set zero degrees as the coldest temperatures one would likely experience in Western Europe. An alternative temperature scale—the Celsius scale—was invented by Anders Celsius in 1742. His Celsius scale set zero as the point at which water boiled and 100 as the point at which it froze. In the late 1700s when Carl Linnaeus inverted the scale to make zero degrees reflect water’s freezing point and 100 degrees to reflect its boiling point, the Celsius scale became popular.Global temperature change is the key aspect of climate receiving the most attention from scientists and policy makers, primarily since it affects other climate patterns. For example, a drastic drop in average temperatures could seriously reduce the amount of precipitation that falls, thus diminishing crop production. Other impacts of rising temperatures may include more severe and destructive weather patterns, while the melting of glaciers could cause sea levels to rise. Since temperatures are expected to continue to increase, it is important to understand how the Earth has responded to climate change over the past century so we can be better able to predict how it may respond in the future.
