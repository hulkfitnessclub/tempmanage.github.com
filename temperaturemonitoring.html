	<P>
	Temperature measurement is important wherever temperature-sensitive products are studied, produced, stored or transported. Rotronic offers a range of temperature measuring instruments to this end: from temperature probes and transmitters to handhelds and data loggers. The Rotronic Monitoring System makes it possible to access temperature and other necessary measured data at any time from anywhere in the world.

Temperature measurement often goes hand-in-hand with humidity measurement. You can also find examples of humidity measurement and temperature monitoring under Applications & Industries
