	An operating temperature is the temperature at which an electrical or mechanical device operates. The device will operate effectively within a specified temperature range (which part; TJ usually) which varies based on the device function and application context, and ranges from the minimum operating temperature to the maximum operating temperature (or peak operating temperature). Outside this range of safe operating temperatures the device may fail. Aerospace and military-grade (MIL-STD or FAA?) devices generally operate over a broader temperature range than industrial devices; commercial-grade[clarification needed] devices generally have the narrowest operating temperature range. Electrical and mechanical devices used in military and aerospace applications may need to endure greater environmental variability, including temperature range.

In the United States Department of Defense has defined the United States Military Standard for all products used by the United States Armed Forces. A product's environmental design and test limits to the conditions that it will undergo throughout its service life are specified in MIL-STD-810, the Department of Defense Test Method Standard for Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests.[5]

The MIL-STD-810G standard specifies that the "operating temperature stabilization is attained when the temperature of the functioning part(s) of the test item considered to have the longest thermal lag is changing at a rate of no more than 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) per hour."[5] It also specifies procedures to assess the performance of materials to extreme temperature loads.[6]

Military engine turbine blades experience two significant deformation stresses during normal service, creep and thermal fatigue.[7] Creep life of a material is "highly dependent on operating temperature",[7] and creep analysis is thus an important part of design validation. Some of the effects of creep and thermal fatigue may be mitigated by integrating cooling systems into the device's design, reducing the peak temperature experienced by the metal.
